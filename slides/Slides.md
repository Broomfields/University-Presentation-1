<!-- Slides[3.1] Project Introduction -->

## Introduction

Support Tracker will be an internal tool used by Tascomp to effectively manage and track customer inquiries, technical issues, and support requests. The overarching aim is to streamline communication, thus expediting the resolution time for reported issues.

Initiated in July 2023, the project is a graded ICA to be performed as a work-project at Tascomp and to be graded as part of the Software Engineer Degree-Apprenticeship course at Teesside University.

<!-- Slides[3.2] Project Value -->

## Project Value

The project holds significant value to Tascomp as it will significantly enhance our existing support processes, benefitting both Tascomp and its customers.

With a key revenue stream coming from support contracts with users of our Prodigy, PlantRun, and PAMS systems, it is imperative that we provide an efficient, user-friendly system for handling support issues.

Moreover, some of our clients, especially those affiliated with government agencies, necessitate distinct support ticket IDs, further emphasizing the importance of this project.

<!-- Slides[3.3] Reason for Development -->

## Reason for Development

The primary motivation for developing Support Tracker is to overcome the limitations of our current system, which was not initially designed for logging and tracking support events and interactions, thus rendering it unwieldy when used as a ticketing system.

Its design was primarily for managing other operational aspects of support contracts, and therefore lacks efficiency and ease-of-use when deployed as a ticketing system. This project was hence initiated to create a new, dedicated ticketing system, specifically designed to handle customer inquiries, technical issues, and support requests effectively and efficiently.

<!-- Slides[3.5] Quantitative Incentives -->

## Quantitative Incentives

 | Incentive                      | Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
 | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | Enhanced Efficiency            | The new streamlined internal support ticketing system will significantly improve operational efficiency by reducing response times and minimising manual processes, leading to increased productivity and time savings for the senior leadership team.                                                                                  |
 | Cost Savings                   | The implementation of the new system will result in cost savings by reducing the need for dedicated support staff, streamlining workflows, and minimizing errors. These savings can be reinvested in other areas of the company or allocated to strategic initiatives.                                                                  |
 | Data-Driven Insights           | The system generates valuable data and metrics on support tickets, allowing senior leadership to identify trends, areas for improvement, and potential training needs. This data-driven approach enables informed decision-making and more effective resource allocation.                                                               |
 | Risk Mitigation                | By implementing a centralised support ticketing system, the company can reduce the risk of lost or misplaced tickets, ensuring that no customer requests or critical issues fall through the cracks. This mitigates potential reputational risks and customer dissatisfaction.                                                          |
 | Enhanced Customer Experience   | The efficient handling of support tickets will result in faster issue resolution for customers, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. This positive customer experience can have a direct impact on the companyâ€™s reputation and bottom line.                                                                         |
 | Compliance and Accountability  | The streamlined system will enable better tracking and monitoring of support ticket status, ensuring accountability and compliance with service level agreements (SLAs) and other performance metrics. This will help the senior leadership team in maintaining high standards of customer service and meeting regulatory requirements. |
 | Improved Decision Making       | The systemâ€™s potential for comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities will provide all teams with different sets of historical and real-time data and insights on support ticket trends, allowing for informed decision making and proactive problem-solving.                                                                   |
 | Enhanced Auditing Capabilities | The incorporation of robust auditing features within the ticketing system will enable the organization to meet new certifications, standards, and compliance, enhancing its ability to bid for more advantageous contracts with customers that require such things.                                                                     |

<!-- Slides[3.8] Management -->

## Project Management

For software development, project management exists in a limited capacity.
Currently it is almost entirely performed through weekly software meetings and the use of an internal tool named Mantis.

These meetings serve as a platform for the software team to discuss and evaluate the status of the previous week's deliverables.

Once evaluated, developers propose tasks for the upcoming week, informing their colleagues and the product owner about their intended tasks. For each prospective task, the importance, priority, and necessity are discussed and negotiated.

Although not explicitly defined as such, these meetings bear a resemblance to the sprint-scrum style of agile development, contributing to an agile-like methodology for our project.

## Development Methodology

<div class="columns">
<div style="width:700px">

Our team uses... I don't really know what Development Methodology we use... Its kind of a mix of a bunch of things, mostly traditional, but the programming section of the development process is gaining more and more agile aspects as time goes on.

</div>
<div style="margin-left:200px;width:400px;float:right;">

Here's a simplified overview of our process in phases:

- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

## Mantis

<div style="width:100%; height:100%" class="columns">

  <div>

  As seen in the development process flow-chart, every new code addition, be it a new or existing project, requires a Mantis entry.

  Mantis is an internal tool developed and utilised by the company to track all code development, speficially tracking code changes against Prodigy builds.

<!-- Slides[6.1] Project Testing -->

## Project Testing

There are three types of testing to be covered in this project.

Testing Type         | Description                                                          | Implementation
---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------
Acceptance Testing   | Ensures the solution meets business requirements and is fit for purpose. | Performed through user scenarios and use cases to verify that the system fulfils its intended requirements.
Integration Testing  | Evaluates how different components or modules interact and operate together. | Conducted by combining individual units of the software and testing them as a group, ensuring that integrated units function as expected.
Unit Testing         | Focuses on individual parts (or units) of the software to ascertain they function correctly. | Utilises automated test cases written by the developer to test individual functions or methods within the application.

<!-- Slides[6.2] Testing Document Reference -->

## Acceptance Testing Document

For every new code project, a test document is created and approved.

The following test document provides a set of user scenarios and user stories for each view in the front-end component of the application, allowing the user-interface to be formally and comprehensively tested:

<!-- Slides[6.3] Further testing through Unit Tests -->

## Further testing through Unit Tests

<div style="width:100%; height:100%" class="columns">

  <div>

  Although testing through code has yet to become standard practice at Tascomp,
  Support Tracker contains a variety of unit tests that perform various integration level and unit level tests through code.
