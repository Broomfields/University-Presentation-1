<!-- Slides[3.1] Project Introduction -->

## Introduction

Support Tracker will be an internal tool used by Tascomp to effectively manage and track customer inquiries, technical issues, and support requests. The overarching aim is to streamline communication, thus expediting the resolution time for reported issues.

Initiated in July 2023, the project is a graded ICA to be performed as a work-project at Tascomp and to be graded as part of the Software Engineer Degree-Apprenticeship course at Teesside University.

<!-- Slides[3.2] Project Value -->

## Project Value

The project holds significant value to Tascomp as it will significantly enhance our existing support processes, benefitting both Tascomp and its customers.

With a key revenue stream coming from support contracts with users of our Prodigy, PlantRun, and PAMS systems, it is imperative that we provide an efficient, user-friendly system for handling support issues.

Moreover, some of our clients, especially those affiliated with government agencies, necessitate distinct support ticket IDs, further emphasizing the importance of this project.

<!-- Slides[3.3] Reason for Development -->

## Reason for Development

The primary motivation for developing Support Tracker is to overcome the limitations of our current system, which was not initially designed for logging and tracking support events and interactions, thus rendering it unwieldy when used as a ticketing system.

Its design was primarily for managing other operational aspects of support contracts, and therefore lacks efficiency and ease-of-use when deployed as a ticketing system. This project was hence initiated to create a new, dedicated ticketing system, specifically designed to handle customer inquiries, technical issues, and support requests effectively and efficiently.

## Ethical Considerations and Compliance

A key constraint we must keep in mind during the development of our ticketing system is the need to follow ethical guidelines and relevant regulations. Being based in the UK, there are particular ethical factors we must take into account:

| Point | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data Protection and Privacy | Considering that the ticketing system will likely handle sensitive and personal data pertaining to customers, their site systems, and their support interactions, it is of utmost importance that we adhere to the regulations set forth by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and any other relevant data protection laws applicable in the UK. This ensures the proper safeguarding of customerâ€™s privacy and data integrity. |
| Equitable and Unbiased Treatment | We must design and implement our ticketing system to promote equity and prevent any form of discrimination. Any algorithms or decision-making processes used within the system need to be transparent, explainable, and free from biases linked to race, gender, age, or any other protected characteristic. |
| Confidentiality and Security | Safeguarding the confidentiality and security of data within the ticketing system holds paramount importance. To mitigate the risks of data leaks and potential breaches of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), a crucial step is to employ encryption techniques to protect the database. |
| Accessibility and Inclusivity | It's crucial that we design and develop our ticketing system with accessibility in mind, making sure it's usable by people with disabilities. We need to think about offering alternative means of access for users with varying abilities or needs. |

<!-- Slides[3.8] Management -->

## Project Management

For software development, project management exists in a limited capacity.
Currently it is almost entirely performed through weekly software meetings and the use of an internal tool named Mantis.

These meetings serve as a platform for the software team to discuss and evaluate the status of the previous week's deliverables.

Once evaluated, developers propose tasks for the upcoming week, informing their colleagues and the product owner about their intended tasks. For each prospective task, the importance, priority, and necessity are discussed and negotiated.

Although our development processes largely follow a traditional route, the recent introducution of these weekly software meetings bear a resemblance to the sprint-scrum style of agile development, contributing to agile-like elements for our project management.

<!-- Slides[5.1] Development Platform -->

## Development Platform

- Long before the current era of developing for `Windows`, Tascomp utilised an ancient technology knows as `OS9`, this was a real-time operating system.
- Eventually, once Windows had become more stable, Tascomp migrated its `C` codebase to be developed for the platform.
- Tascomp's code-base for `Prodigy`, its derived variants, and Tascomp's orbiting components, such as `Support Tracker`, are all developed for the Windows platform, targeting Windows 10 and 11.

<!--

 - Tell them about the development platform.
 - Wait a second

 -->

---

<!-- Slides[5.2] Languages and Frameworks -->

## Languages and Frameworks

- At our code-base's heart is `C`, forming the backbone of our libraries, programs, and essential services.
- Our `C++` layer has expansive reach, originating with `Win32` back-end and over time moving to `MFC` for both back-end and front-end.
- `C++/CLI`'s merger with `Windows Forms` marks our tech evolution, drawing on `.NET Framework 4` to redefine our front-end prowess and library offerings.
- `Support Tracker` embodies adaptability, centring on `C++/CLI`, but based in `MFC` to synergise with specific Tascomp libraries.
- Navigating the legacy tapestry and tooling constraints, notably utilising a long deprecated source control solution as well as having to cater for `Visual Studio Platform v100`, necessitates that we cannot use anything later than `.NET Framework 4`.

<!-- 
Script: 
 - Tell them about the codebase.
 - Wait a second
 - Move to next slide
 -->

---

<!-- Slides[5.3] Source Control -->

## Source Control

- We employ `Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6` as our primary version control system, utilising its centralised source-control solution, though bypassing its branching capabilities.
- Virtualisation aids our process; each major product version, with an example being Prodigy version 11, resides in its dedicated virtual machine, like Build Machine 11's SourceSafe database.
- To navigate builds and variants, we interweave batch scripts and our proprietary solutions, enabling streamlined management of build types, including Beta and Release.

<div class="smaller-text">

> It is important to note that utilising Sourcesafe as our source-control solution blocks us from using any visual studio platform later than `v142` and so blocks us from using any version of .NET later than `.NET Framework v4.8`. Git would be the most logical next-step in the future.

<!-- Slides[5.4] Databases -->

## Databases

- Tascomp's core products stand on the foundation of our unique, internal proprietary database technologies. These are largely hidden as to users and managed by back-end components which communicate with fron-end components.
- Our product layers extend support to three primary databases: `Microsoft Access`, `Microsoft SQL Server`, and `Oracle`.
- Historically, `Microsoft Access` was our preferred choice, but recent inclinations lean heavily towards `Microsoft SQL Server`.
- All internal tools, once rooted in `Microsoft Access`, have transitioned to `Microsoft SQL Server`, consolidating in the shared server `TSC-Server`, the same repository designated for the Support Tracker's database.

<!-- Slides[5.5] Development Environments -->

## Development Environments

- `Visual Studio 2010` is the primary IDE across Tascomp's software division. However, certain developers, including myself, and all our build machines are equipped with `Visual Studio 2019` to tap into platform `v142` and `.NET Framework v4.8` capabilities.
- Our internal toolkit is vast and varied. From handling our exclusive domain language `SLANG` to meticulous program, queue, and data-module diagnostics, these tools embody diverse roles, ensuring an optimised development environment.
- Personally, an array of Microsoft utilities, like `Visual Studio Code`, `Windows Terminal`, `WSL2`, and `SysInternal Suite`, are indispensable, aiding in a streamlined development experience.

<!-- Slides[6.4] Modifying Existing Projects -->

## Modifying Existing Projects

Mirroring the existing styles when modifying a project refers to maintaining the same coding conventions, formatting, and naming conventions that have already been established in an existing project when making modifications or adding new code. By mirroring the existing styles, the modified code seamlessly integrates with the rest of the project and maintains a consistent and unified codebase.

---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------
Acceptance Testing   | Ensures the solution meets business requirements and is fit for purpose. | Performed through user scenarios and use cases to verify that the system fulfils its intended requirements.
Integration Testing  | Evaluates how different components or modules interact and operate together. | Conducted by combining individual units of the software and testing them as a group, ensuring that integrated units function as expected.
Unit Testing         | Focuses on individual parts (or units) of the software to ascertain they function correctly. | Utilises automated test cases written by the developer to test individual functions or methods within the application.

# Where does it go?

Given that the development process previously mentioned has taken place, and a final release candidate has been built on the appropriate virtual machine, the `Support Tracker` front-end executable/s and back-end dynamic-link-libraries will be manually moved to the appropriate location on the `TSC-SERVER` and a shortcut will be added to the `Tascomp Shortcuts` directory on the main internal server.

If this system were a component within Tascomp's `Prodigy` or derived products, then it would automatically be included in the relevant installer and no manual actions would be required.

# C4 Model Overview

- C4, encapsulating **Context**, **Containers**, **Components**, and **Code**, is a tailored blueprint for elucidating software architecture.
- Through its quad-tiered design, it shifts from a panoramic system overview to the minutiae of code constructs.
- This stratified schematic allows stakeholders to oscillate between the system's macroscopic function and its detailed operations effortlessly.
- When harnessed for charting out project architecture, C4 stands as a beacon of lucidity, harmonising interpretations, and smoothing dialogues.
